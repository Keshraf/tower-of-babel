        <h1>Welcome to Language Learning</h1>

        <p>
            Learning a new language can be an exciting adventure. This extension helps you learn
            naturally while reading content you enjoy. As you browse the web, certain words will
            be translated to help you expand your vocabulary.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p>
            The extension intelligently selects words based on your learning level. Beginners will
            see common, everyday words translated, while advanced learners will encounter more
            sophisticated vocabulary. You can hover over any translated word to see its meaning
            and hear its pronunciation.
        </p>

        <h2>Building Your Skills</h2>

        <p>
            Consistent practice is essential for language acquisition. By encountering new words
            in context, you develop a deeper understanding of how the language works. This
            immersive approach helps you remember words more effectively than traditional
            memorization techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>Progressive Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Start with simple content and gradually increase difficulty as you become more
            comfortable. The extension adapts to show you appropriate vocabulary for your current
            skill level. Whether you're reading news articles, blog posts, or educational content,
            you'll always find opportunities to learn.
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural Context</h2>

        <p>
            Understanding a language means understanding its culture. As you learn vocabulary,
            you'll also gain insights into how native speakers express ideas and emotions. This
            cultural awareness enhances your communication skills and makes language learning
            more meaningful and enjoyable.
